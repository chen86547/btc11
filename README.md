Digital currency exchange model:

Fiat currency exchange

It can be divided into on-exchange/over-the-counter exchanges. On-exchange exchanges are a way to purchase digital assets from the exchange through credit card or bank card transfers; OTC exchanges are where users match with another user through the exchange. A transaction method for completing digital asset payments outside of exchanges.

Coin exchange

Users can convert digital assets they already own into other digital assets, and the entire transaction process does not involve any legal currency.

futures exchange

Futures trading risks are relatively high, leverage trading is allowed, the threshold is high, and the audience is relatively small.

Digital currency exchange features:

1. Coin-to-coin matching system: Memory-level matching engine, the transaction speed is doubled, and it can stay away from card machines and hang-ups.

2. Market charts: Comprehensive market data, effective acquisition of information, and clear market trends.

3. Risk control system: Strict risk control system, real-time monitoring of platform data.

The security of digital currency exchanges reflects:

1. Distributed deployment, once the system is attacked, only one part is damaged, and the other part can still run normally;

2. Separate the front and backend, so that even if there is a black technology attack on the frontend, the data in the backend will at least be safe;

3. Memory matching, which will process data concurrency faster and facilitate transactions quickly;
